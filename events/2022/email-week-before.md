## What to bring

### Items for the _Swap Shop_

Help yourself to free items at the "Swap Shop"!
If you have any small working components, items or tools you think anyone else could use for any projects please bring them to the event for the "swap shop".

### Possible ideas for a talk

Talks are informal and can be on (almost) any topic you like. The best talks are those on accessible topics that will appeal to the diverse audience we expect to attend the event. You don't need "a PowerPoint". Talks can be off the cuff, on the spot, interactive, more like a discussion session.
