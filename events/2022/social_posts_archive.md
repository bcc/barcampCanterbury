If your coming to @BarCampCanterbury this week, be sure to bring some old tech or tools that you want to recycle. I'm sure someone would love your junk to start their own projects with! Bring it along to join our free swap shop! #barcamp



We're bringing engineering and computing students from @CanterburyCCUni @computing_cccu @UniKentComp together for free food and a chance to talk about cool projects!
Only a couple of weeks to grab your free tickets for https://barcampcanterbury.com Saturday 29th October. #barcamp


#BarCamp's are always free and open for the whole community to attend.
    This year at https://barcampcanterbury.com the food and refreshments are being provided by @CanterburyCCUni School of Engineering Technology and Design.
    Let's bring the local community of makers together!


    Looking for a tech talk fix before BarCamp Canterbury? Check out our friends at @codeHarbour next week!


    One of the things we do at #BarCampCanterbury is run a "Swap Shop".
        If you have any old equipment, tools, materials or bits that you're not really using but think someone else might make use of it, then bring it along! To add to a table of "Free stuff".


        The purpose of #BarCamp's is for the attendees to give talks. We don't expect PowerPoints or any preparation. Just grab a room and timeslot and just talk. You'd be surprised at how many people would be interested!


        We recently found that a YouTube engineering legend is based in Canterbury. We stumbled past https://youtube.com/c/RobertMurraySmithâ€¦ 's workshop and were blown away by his enthusiasm and pure un-distilled tinkering! He's interested in https://barcampcanterbury.com and sharing a love of engineering


        It's going to be great to have our first #BarCamp Canterbury in 3 years.
We're hoping for a great crowd of budding young tinkerers, makers and inquisitive minds from @CanterburyCCUni and @UniKentComp.
Join us and get involved on Saturday 29th October


We're delighted that The Institution of Engineering and Technology @TheIET has given @BarCampCant a thumbs up. 
Getting communities together to talk and build cool stuff benefits everyone. 
Come join us at @CanterburyCCUni on Saturday 29th October!


At @BarCampCant people talk about their cool prototype tech ideas. 
@_The_Familiar are a Canterbury based company that have been designing, prototyping and testing for 18 years! They will be talking about some of their process at our event on 29th October.

Thanks for those who have given advice so far, but would be great to get some more.


Calling all BarCamp regulars and veterans. What advice would you give to someone thinking about coming to a BarCamp for the first time?
