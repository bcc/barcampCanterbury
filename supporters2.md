# BarCamp Sponsorship

## What is BarCamp?

BarCamp Canterbury is a free-to-attend un-conference where the attendees create the content and give the talks with the theme loosely around technology. Over the years, this has been a highly successful event where impassioned members of the local community and beyond share their experiences. 

Example talks from previous years include:
* Building a voice activated arcade cabinet 
* It's not THAT scary - basic car maintenance
* AI-Generated Presentations 
* Accessibility in VR 
* The Science of Happiness
* 100 Programming Languages Speedrun

A sample of talks can also be viewed on our Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BarCampCanterbury/videos


## Sponsorship Opportunities

Our aim is not only to provide a space for local techs to share their creativity but also to encourage the younger generation and those new to the area of STEM. By supporting BarCamp we can continue to run this event free of charge for our attendees and to support our local community. 

Examples of sponsorship include:
* Lunch and snacks throughout the event
* Drinks during the post event social
* Souvenirs
* Prizes


## Supporter Goals

Sponsorship isn’t just about BarCamp! 
As organisers for BarCamp we aim to support your company’s goals such as recruitment, networking, CSR or brand awareness. This can be done in a variety of ways which can be catered to suit your individual needs such as:
* Logo placement. This can include, but is not limited to:
    * The BarCamp website
    * Flyers
    * Digital signage (on university campus)
    * YouTube videos 
    * Freebies (such as coasters and stickers) 
    * Vinyl banners (Visible in each event room. Talks may be filmed with this signage present)
* Shoutouts on social media and at the event
* Facilitate a memorable gadget/item. Previous examples include branded mugs with attendee names and interactive digital badges
* Provide non-sales talks for the attendees (the focus should be on the tech involved rather than the benefits it can have to the audience).
* Any suggestions your organisation may have!
