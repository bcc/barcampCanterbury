Guide to Running BarCamp Canterbury
===================================

BarCamp
-------

BarCamp is an established format for an free and open 'un-conference'.

* [BarCamp on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp)
* [barcamp.org](http://barcamp.org)


Terminology
-----------

* The ethos of Barcamp is free, open, community.
* Some terms and phrases that do not align with these principles can cause friction.
* Business terminology is suggested to be avoided.


Timeline
--------

1. Secure venue
    * Catering
    * Risk Assessment
2. Secure supporter (logo's of local organisations that support local tech community)
3. Adverting (digital signage in universitys + schools?)


Venue
-----

* Event
    * Venue
        * [University of Kent: School of Computing](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/) has generously donated space in previous years
            * [Woolf College](https://www.kent.ac.uk/maps/canterbury/canterbury-campus/building/woolf-college)
        * [Canterbury Christ Church University: verena-holmes-building](https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/study-here/student-life/our-locations/canterbury-campus/verena-holmes-building)
    * Hands-on and Share Space
        * People bring in cool things to show
            * E.g. sewing machines, retro machines, electronics
    * Workshop Space (optional)
    * Evening social/food Venue
        * For continued socialising should be organised.
        * Transport and accessibility for attendees between venues should be considered
        * [Gulbenkian cafe](https://thegulbenkian.co.uk/your-visit/eat-drink/) event catering have cordoned off areas in previous years

Accessibility should be considered
* Wheelchair access
* Parking
* Distance between rooms/events


Branding
--------

Historically
https://github.com/vext01/barcamp-canterbury-branding
It would be good to keep all resources in a single repo

Use of the 'University of Kent' logo is restricted to formal university activities only.
We can use the Kent logo only in the context of 'School of Computing'.

Catering
--------

* Refreshments to facilitate attendee's focused and interacting during the day. Sponsorship provides finances for refreshments.
* Check what are valid/approved food vendors for your venue.


* Coffee (throughout)
    * Investigate the hire of a coffee machine/cart/supplier? Maybe a sponsor? Venue catering teams can ensure this is managed
* Lunch
    * For events taking place on the University of Kent campus, authorised vendors should provide catering
        * [Kent Hospitality](https://www.kent.ac.uk/hospitality/)
    * For events not taking place on the University of Kent campus
        * [Sainsburys Select](https://select.sainsburys.co.uk/)
            * Must be ordered 1 week beforehand
* Dinner
    * [Domino's](https://www.dominos.co.uk/) is a registered supplier for University of Kent and provide bulk discount
    * Pizza is the best 'price point'. 
        * As this is a free community event, it is regrettable, but we can't provide specialist food

Finances
--------

Supporters
-----------

* Requesting 'Sponsorship' was not effective. Many small organisations did not have money.
    * Sponsor (implys commercial involvement)
* What we want is 'support'. Logo's of organisation 'legitimise' our event
    * The following terms have formal connertaions and should not be used
        * 'affiliated'
        * 'associated'
        * 'endorsed'
        

### Supporters (financial/donation)

Talks from organisations/commercial-interests are discouraged.
They should be relevant to the community.

If we do want to approach supporter for money
* Identify _Supporter Objectives_
* Testimonials from previous supporters
* Social Media Reach (numbers)
* Number of Attendees
* Years running
* Videos

* Example feedback pitch

            * This keeps communication transparent and prevents us from holding personal data

Activities
----------

    * Small working devices or tools that your are not using to be given to other hackers that needs them
    * Ideas
        * Raspbery pi1's, power supplys, nuts/bolts/hardware, fabric, wood offcuts, adhesives, LED's, lights, tools, wire, old laptops, duplicates of games, cards.

    * Safer than a 30min talk

It is recommended that larger overarching activities are not encouraged. This takes the focus away from the talks. Activities should be time-boxed to a timeslot if needed.
